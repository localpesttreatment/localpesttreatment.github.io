<p>Pests controlled: Use horticultural oils to combat aphids, mites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Under EPM, chemicals must be utilized only as a last resort, after mechanical, cultural, and biological techniques have actually been attempted and revealed inefficient. Various pest control chemicals are toxic and might be damaging, if not used correctly.</p>
<p>If pesticides are needed, they are picked and applied in such a way that avoids interfering with other IPM practices. Almost every kind of pest presents a threat to the residential or commercial properties they inhabit, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>

<p>Todays professionals use Integrated Pest Management methods which include traps and exclusion approaches to control pests. 2Standard Covered Pests consist of cockroaches, mice, rats, silverfish, "house" ants (omitting carpenter ants, fire ants, pharaoh ants & tawny crazy ants), clothes moths, non-poisonous spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, earwigs, home crickets and paper wasps.</p>
<p>Biological control approaches can also be viewed as natural services as they do not rely on using pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is necessary because rodents and insects carry illness, infest your kitchen areas and bed rooms, and bite you or your pets. Use indicator plants to figure out the effectiveness of pest management techniques and to keep an eye on prone crops for the infections (tospoviruses) such as impatiens lethal area virus (INSV) and tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV).</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, remain in the environment for days, weeks or even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential part of an incorporated pest management programme. However by concentrating on non-chemical alternatives first, you can make sure that your pest management program is effectively removing pests at the least danger to your food security program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
