<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program is a effective and environmentally delicate  approach to pest control. These may or might not include products listed on the Organic Products Review Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and especially insecticides used in organic farming and organic gardening are usually much safer than artificial pesticides, they are not constantly more safe or eco-friendly than artificial pesticides and can trigger damage.</p>
<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the effectiveness of environmentally unsound approaches in addition to its variety of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, strains of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the likelihood that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
