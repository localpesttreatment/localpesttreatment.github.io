<p>A pest specialist can help implement a customized Integrated Pest Management program for your business. This was supported by an extensive set of paperwork, covering approved pesticides, the competence of the pest control operator, application sites, and application methods, to name a few details as laid out in Chapter 1. These were monitored on an everyday, weekly, and month-to-month basis, as relevant.</p>
<p>If pesticides are essential, they are selected and applied in such a way that prevents interrupting other IPM practices. Practically every kind of pest positions a hazard to the residential or commercial properties they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the execution of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses a number of the exact same principles as IPM but limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
