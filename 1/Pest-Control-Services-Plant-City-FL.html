When stored for a long time, kept product pests are most likely to be in a food ingredient on delivery to a processing factory or a processed food item. Using pesticides to crops, animals, structures or landscapes on a regular basis, despite requirement, is not IPM.

<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is considered as a ecologically benign and cost-effective  pest control method preferably suited for both little and large farmers around the globe. As soon as termites have entered a building, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be deemed a decision-making process in which observations (from inspection and tracking) are utilized to make pest control choices based on pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, remain in the environment for days, weeks or perhaps longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an important part of an integrated pest management program.
