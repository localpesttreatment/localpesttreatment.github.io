<p>Pest management requires a holistic technique to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied just after routine tracking shows that a pest population had actually reached an economic limit level. Lots of individual commodity growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM implies for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are readily available in restricted locations.</p>

To measure IPM adoption, it is required to recognize the aspects that determine whether a pest control program qualifies as an IPM system. Pest-tolerant crops such as soybeans may not call for interventions unless the pests are many or quickly increasing.</p>

Classical biological control includes presenting natural enemies from a pest's native range into a new location where native natural opponents do not provide control.</p>
