<p>More details is required about food-chain concentration and practical methods of removing destructive results of pesticide residues that might stay in the environment after the pesticides have served their function. Don't base pest management programs on total elimination of a pest. Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae ruin leaves and berries originating from the ground, and birds consume fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
<p>In IPM, pesticides are used only when required and in combination with other techniques for more reliable, long-lasting control. The benefits of GM crops extend beyond the reduction in insecticides, due to the fact that they work with other pest management tactics, particularly biological control.
