Crop losses due to arthropods, illness, and weeds, though challenged by some as a valid procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the intensification of pest control.</p>
<p>IPM techniques include both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest efficient dosage when other methods of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of methods such as biological control, environment manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
