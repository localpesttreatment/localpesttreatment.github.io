<p>Socio-psychological factors including reasonable and moral factors to consider were discovered to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness incident and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that an absence of qualified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM execution in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>4 ). With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is considered as a economical and environmentally benign pest control method ideally matched for both small and big farmers around the world. Once termites have gone into a building, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be deemed a decision-making process in which observations (from evaluation and monitoring) are used to make pest control decisions based on pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>Tighter regulations for food safety, occupational health and safety, and the environment imply internal pest control isn't a choice for many food businesses these days. Farmers are confronted with myriad of production difficulties where the most typical issues are pests, that include illness, weeds, and insects. Likewise, pest and crop management disciplines should collaborate to establish control suggestions that reflect these interactions.</p>
<p>This method of pest control has fallen out of favour in current decades given that fire eliminates advantageous insects together with the pests and can have a negative effect on the soil. To minimize potential harm to advantageous insects, limit your spraying to small areas where you can see pests hiding, and leave a couple of unsprayed "refuges" for any great bugs you can't see.</p>
