<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the community as an entire and thinks about a balanced mix of the abovementioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least harmful plan.</p>
