<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is generally utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has actually been efficiently used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>A comprehensive knowledge of general IPM principles and various management alternatives for all possible pest problems is essential as some are preventive and others are curative. We generally recommend pest control chemicals that finish the job using the least amount of item. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last option).
