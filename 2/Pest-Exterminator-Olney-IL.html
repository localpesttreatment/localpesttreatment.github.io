<p>Termites consume furniture, papers, books, and even files kept in lockers and safes, hence causing enormous damage within just a few months. This stops the pest getting resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or applied to the crops. Exterminators go to customer houses and companies to inspect for insects or rodents. Classical biological control includes introducing natural enemies from a pest's native variety into a new location where native natural enemies do not offer control.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, linger in the environment for days, weeks or even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be a crucial part of an integrated pest management program. However by concentrating on non-chemical choices initially, you can ensure that your pest management program is efficiently removing pests at the least threat to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
