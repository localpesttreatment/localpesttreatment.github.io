Greenhouses offer an ideal environment (e.g., temperature level and light) for numerous biological control agents or natural opponents including parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogenic nematodes.</p>
<p>Some likewise recognized that if regionally collaborated IPM might happen, even yearly management of a consistent pest could be made more effective (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We recruit exterminators who concentrate on business or commercial pest control.
