<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the ecosystem as an entire and considers a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived harmful metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, similar to synthetic chemicals, and have a lot of the ecological and human security risks as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>The human action depends upon the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to efforts to entirely eliminate the pest.
