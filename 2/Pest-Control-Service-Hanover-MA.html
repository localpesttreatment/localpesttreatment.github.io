<p>The habits of the pest can be exploited for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and mating disruption methods (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). When distributed in the field or placed in traps, baits consisting of harmful material will bring in and kill the pests.</p>
<p>IPM is utilized in agriculture, gardening, forestry, human habitations, preventive preservation and general pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and decorative pest management. Treat a pest infestation with a hand sprayer, fertilize your turf with a granular spreader, take on termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with a professional bait weapon, or use pre-emergent herbicides with a knapsack sprayer.</p>
