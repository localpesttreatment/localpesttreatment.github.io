Owner assessed pruritus severity was significantly reduced from baseline on all post-treatment collection days for both treatments, and fluralaner-treated cats had significantly less severe pruritus than selamectin treated cats on days 21 and 28-30 (Table 4 ). Improvement in owner-assessed pruritus correlates with reductions in flea numbers and is consistent with a reduction in flea bites.">
