Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been suggested as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove since growers were not ready for such an intercropping plan. If your facility currently makes use of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be surprised to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>
<p>A specific pest can be controlled by particular options, but they might not all be readily available in a specific place, for a specific crop, or within the available financial methods. IPM includes using the best mix of cultural, biological and chemical steps for particular circumstances, including plant biotechnology as suitable. This preparation consists of attention to field histories to anticipate what the pest issues might be, selecting crop varieties which are resistant or tolerant to pest damage, selecting tillage systems that will suppress awaited pest damage while providing the crop the best yield potential.</p>
