<p>Our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) method is based upon our four principles that together we call ERDM. We understand that finding pests in your home or business is stressful. Flexibility and Time- The process of pest control requires time and efforts. Pests are unwanted plants, animals, insects, germs or other organisms that interfere with human activity.</p>
<p>This details, in mix with readily available pest control approaches, is used to handle pest damage by the most economical methods, and with the minimal risk to people, property, and the environment. Applications of pesticides are constantly the last option in an IPM program. This is talked about in Chapter 16. Changes in cultural, agricultural, and financial patterns throughout the world have actually had a profound effect on insect-pest management and control.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production applies a lot of the same concepts as IPM but restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of artificial chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
