The chemical controls are used only after routine monitoring indicates that a pest population had reached an economic threshold level. Numerous specific product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM means for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in minimal areas.</p>
