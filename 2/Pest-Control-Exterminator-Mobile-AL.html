When saved for a long time, kept product pests are most likely to be in a food ingredient on delivery to a processing factory or a processed food product. Using pesticides to crops, animals, structures or landscapes on a regular basis, no matter need, is not IPM. The reliance on pesticides as a sole technique of control has led to the development of insect resistance and unfavorable impacts on human health, natural enemies, and the environment.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and prevent pest perseverance consist of intercropping (several crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
