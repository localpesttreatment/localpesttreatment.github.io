<p>Their expert exterminators are available for 24 hours of emergency services for their valuable customers. However, the high capacity for reproduction of insect pests stays, and a population surge of lots of species can be anticipated from a low-density level whenever suitable ecological conditions occur or control slackens. Under this scheme, pest control was "monitored" by certified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from regular monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest effective dose when other approaches of pest control have actually stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that focuses on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of techniques such as biological control, environment control, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
