<p>There is no clear clinical evidence that consuming crop products originated from genetically engineered plants has actually caused destructive effects to human beings or animals (e.g., 75% of all cheeses contain chymosin, which is, and has actually been for a long time, produced with genetically crafted germs). In numerous developing nations, where IPM is now governmental policy, pesticide usage is being lowered.</p>
<p>When stored for a long time, stored product pests are most likely to be in a food active ingredient on shipment to a processing factory or a processed food product. Using pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a routine basis, no matter need, is not IPM. The reliance on pesticides as a sole technique of control has actually resulted in the development of insect resistance and negative impacts on human health, natural opponents, and the environment.</p>
