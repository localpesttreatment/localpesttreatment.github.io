<p>For some jobs, pest control workers utilize a mix of pest management strategies, a practice called incorporated pest management. The foundation of an effective IPM program is a schedule of routine inspections. Crop losses due to diseases, weeds, and arthropods, though contested by some as a valid step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the climax of pest control.</p>
