IPM includes using the best combination of cultural, chemical and biological measures for particular circumstances, consisting of plant biotechnology as suitable.

Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the components or product packaging, and the center itself will attract pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
