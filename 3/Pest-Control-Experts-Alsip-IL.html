If outsourced, the food business need to understand it has an equivalent role to play in pest control" with the pest management expert, says Dr. Siddiqi.</p>
<p>A common mistake most companies run into is explaining their business name too literally by using worn-out pest control terms like control, management, pesticide, and insecticide. The pest management industry is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and roughly 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, flies and bees are commonly found pests in our society.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production applies a number of the exact same concepts as IPM but restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to minimize the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
