<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a cost-efficient and ecologically benign pest control method ideally fit for both little and large farmers around the world. When termites have actually gotten in a structure, they do not limit themselves to wood; they likewise damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be deemed a decision-making process in which observations (from inspection and monitoring) are used to make pest control choices based on pre-determined management goals.</p>

Nearly every kind of pest poses a danger to the homes they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the execution of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
