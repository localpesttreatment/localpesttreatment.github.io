<p>When administered by a professional pest control professional, termite treatment works to not only get rid of active infestations but also prevent future ones. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a ecologically delicate and effective approach to pest management that counts on a mix of common-sense practices. IPM is an approach to guarantee economic viability at both consumer and manufacturer level (seller is constantly anticipated to make a profit), ecological security through a well balanced usage of all offered pest control alternatives, and social acceptability given that IPM-based food is safe and affordable.</p>
