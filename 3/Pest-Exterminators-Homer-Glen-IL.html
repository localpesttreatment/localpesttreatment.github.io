<p>In recommendation to the principle of incorporating the use of other and biological controls in complementary ways, the term was later broadened to embrace coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be extremely reliable in causing considerable decreases in pest populations in specific scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural opponents or saving natural enemy populations by supplying havens or preventing practices that harm them are a few of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>There are different pest management tactics to suppress pests. Integrated Pest Management is a decision-making process for handling pests in an effective, environmentally sound and cost-effective way. Although specific crop production and security methods are considered proprietary information, sharing knowledge and resources with each other will improve pest control effectiveness and benefit the whole grower community.</p>
