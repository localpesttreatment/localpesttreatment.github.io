The pest management market is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and roughly 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, insects, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, bees and flies are typically discovered pests in our society.</p>
<p>If, after following preventive and organized management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use chosen biopesticides with low ecological impact. Professional exterminators utilize different types of pesticides and baits to eliminate and get rid of pests.
