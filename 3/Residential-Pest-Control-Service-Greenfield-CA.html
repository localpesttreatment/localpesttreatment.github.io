<p>Dorchester County runs a Mosquito Control Program to safeguard its people from the spread of mosquito-borne illness by spraying pesticides (insecticides), using larvicide to low-lying areas, and informing its residents on lowering the conditions that promote increases in the mosquito population. The goal is to take full advantage of pest mortality while reducing harm to natural opponents.
