<p>Kaolin particle movies used in natural farming may control some pests, but can negatively affect natural opponents and trigger other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices might encourage natural enemy populations, but a greater number of natural opponents does not always lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling utilize nonrenewable fuel sources and indirectly have a negative effect on the environment.</p>
