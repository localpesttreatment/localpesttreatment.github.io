<p>Our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) method is based on our 4 principles that together we call ERDM. We comprehend that discovering pests in your house or business is distressing. Versatility and Time- The process of pest control takes time and efforts. Pests are undesirable plants, animals, insects, bacteria or other organisms that interfere with human activity.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest problems, classical biological control technique is usually utilized where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has been successfully utilized versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses many of the exact same concepts as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to minimize the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
